# COVID-19-Utility-Application v1.5.2 (Alpha)
A program that gathers Coronavirus (COVID-19) data and employs its statistics onto an application GUI. This is the first version, and is a work-in-progress, it will be further updated as more, major changes are made. This was made to further familiarize myself with the Python language. Being in an on-going pandemic, this tool will be useful to view COVID-19 data in an accessible manner for better understanding.  

**This is the version of the COVID-19-Utility that does not use the Streamlit service or webpage-based tools, this is meant to be further updated to use as an application with a GUI, whether it be a mobile version, or a full executable (.exe) program.**



**This program is in its early stages, please do not take COVID-19 data as accurate for the time being until the program has been properly updated to display that information as accurate.**
